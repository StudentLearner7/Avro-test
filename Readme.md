# Camunda 8 Task Overview

## Introduction
This README.md delves into the concept of a "Task" within the Camunda 8 workflow engine, focusing on its role and types in a process.

## What is a Task?
A Task in Camunda 8 represents a unit of work within a process. It's where the actual business logic is executed, potentially involving human interaction or automated systems.

## Types of Tasks
- **User Task:** Requires human interaction for completion. Assigned to specific users or groups.
- **Service Task:** Automated task executed by the engine, calling external services or scripts.
- **Script Task:** Executes a script within the process context.

## Creating and Managing Tasks
Tasks are defined within the BPMN model using Camunda Modeler. Each task type has specific properties and configurations:
- **User Tasks** are configured with assignment details.
- **Service Tasks** require defining the service or script to be called.
- **Script Tasks** involve scripting logic directly in the model.

## Task Lifecycle
1. **Create:** Initiated by the process flow.
2. **Assign:** (User Tasks) Assigned to users based on rules.
3. **Complete:** Task is completed, and the process moves forward.

## Importance
Tasks are fundamental for process execution, enabling detailed control over workflow and the integration of human and automated activities.
