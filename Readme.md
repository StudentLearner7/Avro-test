# Camunda 8 Process Overview

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the concept of a "Process" in Camunda 8, utilizing BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) for designing and automating business workflows.

## What is a Process?
In Camunda 8, a Process is a sequence of tasks and decisions designed to achieve a specific business goal. It's defined using BPMN, a standardized graphical model that depicts the flow of tasks, decisions, events, and gateways.

## Key Components
- **Start Event:** The trigger point of any process.
- **Task:** Represents a piece of work within a process. It can be automated or manual.
- **Gateway:** Decides the direction of flow based on conditions.
- **End Event:** Signifies the completion of the process.

## Creating a Process
1. **Design:** Use Camunda Modeler to drag and drop BPMN elements and design your process.
2. **Deploy:** Deploy the process model to the Camunda 8 engine.
3. **Execute:** The process is instantiated and executed by the engine.

## Importance of Processes
Processes are crucial for automating and optimizing business operations, ensuring efficiency, and providing visibility into business workflows.
