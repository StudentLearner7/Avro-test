import pandas as pd

# Step 1: Process CSV and save to Excel
input_file = 'input.csv'
temp_excel_file = 'temp_output.xlsx'  # Temporary file to hold processed data

# Read CSV, skip the first row from the original data
df = pd.read_csv(input_file, skiprows=1, header=None)

# Manually set new column headers after removing the second column
df.drop(columns=[1], inplace=True)  # Drop the 2nd column
new_header = ['URL', 'pyActivity', 'PreActivity', 'ResponseTime', '#DBCalls', '#API Calls']
df.columns = new_header[:len(df.columns)]  # Assign new headers

# Filtering based on 'JSP/Servlet' condition
for i, row in df.iterrows():
    if row['URL'].startswith('JSP/Servlet') and int(row['pyActivity'].replace(',', '')) < 5000:
        df = df[:i]  # Keep rows up to but not including the row meeting the condition
        break

# Save the DataFrame to an Excel file
df.to_excel(temp_excel_file, index=False)

# Step 2: Apply grouping using openpyxl
from openpyxl import load_workbook

wb = load_workbook(temp_excel_file)
ws = wb.active

# Grouping logic here (assuming grouping is done by some logic you define)
# This example doesn't include specific grouping logic as it depends on your data structure and requirements

# Example of applying a simple grouping, modify as per your actual logic
event_rows = [i+2 for i, url in enumerate(df['URL']) if url.startswith('Event')]  # +2 for Excel's 1-based indexing and header row
for start, end in zip(event_rows, event_rows[1:] + [None]):  # Loop through event start points
    ws.row_dimensions.group(start, end-1 if end else ws.max_row, hidden=True)  # Group rows until the next event row

# Save the modifications back to the original output file
final_output_excel_file = 'output.xlsx'  # Final output file name
wb.save(final_output_excel_file)
