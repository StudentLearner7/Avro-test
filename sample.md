## Getting Started with Custom Workflows

To jumpstart your workflow creation with Camunda 8 using our custom connectors, we've prepared a set of BPMN sample templates. These templates are designed to demonstrate best practices and include predefined elements that leverage our custom connectors for enhanced functionality.

### Downloading and Using BPMN Samples

1. **Download the BPMN Samples:**
   - First, download our `bpmn_samples.zip` folder from the [releases page](#) of this repository. This zip file contains a `.camunda` folder with element templates for our custom connectors, along with several BPMN sample files to get you started.

2. **Extract the ZIP Folder:**
   - Once downloaded, extract the `bpmn_samples.zip` folder to your local machine. Ensure you maintain the folder structure during extraction, especially the `.camunda` folder, as it contains essential configurations for the element templates.

3. **Opening in Camunda Modeler:**
   - Open Camunda Modeler on your computer. If you haven't installed Camunda Modeler yet, you can download it from the [Camunda website](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/).
   - Within Camunda Modeler, navigate to the directory where you extracted the `bpmn_samples.zip` folder.
   - Open the `bpmn` folder within the extracted directory. You should see the sample BPMN files available for editing.

4. **Using Element Templates:**
   - With a BPMN file open in Camunda Modeler, you can access the custom connectors through the element templates feature. These templates are pre-configured in the `.camunda` folder you've extracted, enabling you to drag and drop custom elements into your workflow model.

5. **Building Your Workflow:**
   - Use the provided BPMN samples as a foundation to build your workflows. The element templates included in the `.camunda` folder are designed to streamline the process of integrating custom functionality into your workflows.

### Next Steps
