The Workflow-as-a-Service (WaaS) Wrapper is a robust abstraction layer designed to simplify the integration and management of workflow engines into various applications. This project aims to shield consumers from the complexities inherent in workflow management systems, offering a streamlined, consistent API that remains stable even as the underlying technologies evolve. Initially supporting Camunda 8, the WaaS Wrapper is built with flexibility in mind, ensuring that transitioning to or from different workflow engines does not impact the consumer's experience or require extensive reintegration efforts.
